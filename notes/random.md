We land in paris and walk in the subway and I see an interesting wall art of Le petit prince, but actually it's kinda dumb and pandering. And I stop to ask a local "doesn't that cheapen l'oeuvre to suck it dry like that" and he replies "tourists love that shit". We get to a beautiful old building with stone arches and art everywhere. I'm here for the architecture and you're there for the girl. There's a bombardment and the girl is busy saving the art. We're helping her. It's so beautiful everywhere, she's beautiful, and there so much tension. She's like a princess, she's in charge of all that. And shes a bit flawed and very brave and kind and open minded but she's not opening up to you and you're hurting and acting like it's nothing. But I can see how you're feeling and I see it's only because of the bombs that she's so distant. It's a war. There's a whole network of collaborators. One of them is also one of her lovers. You don't want to know him. We have to go on missions to save precious art with her and I can see something growing between you two. Everything is so beautiful and broken. I just remember you're broken hearted while paris is getting bombed.
